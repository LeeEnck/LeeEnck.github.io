      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        I had previously attended Ephrata senior High School for my general schooling.
        My senior year I then decided to attend Brownstown Votec for Computer Systems Technology.
        There I learned how to take apart/rebuild a laptop or computer. Also how to characterize
        connectors and cables for Ethernet.

        I am now currently attending Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology majoring in computer
        Software Engineering. I personally really enjoy working with computers whether it is building/repairing
        them or now coding programs. Computing is such a facinating world and I am more than excited to see where
        it can take me in life.
