    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>
      Gaming has always been an exciting passtime for me, it is an activity that I utilize
      as just a relaxing exercise for the mind. It is also a great way to keep in touch with
      past friends and blow the dust off some old COD Black Ops Zombies, godly Minecraft worlds,
      or breaking out new and improved fps games. But I originally wanted to get into game
      developing as a possible occupation or side job.

    <h2>Collections</h2>
    <p>
      In my family we have a tradition of starting a collection of items that we find interesting.
      My mother collects pez dispensers and has more than enough, my father has a collection of click pez
      dispensers and also started both my brother and I on collecting Hess Trucks. I also have my own massive
      collection of rocks and minerals that I had started when I was in second grade, I have anything from petrified
      wood, fossils, or even amethyst.

    <h2>Bowling</h2>
    <p>
      I have been Bowling for over 13 years and have won multiple tournaments as a youth bowler.
      I was part of the Ephrata High School Bowling Team which I was the captain of all 4 years.
      We placed first in our section, 3 out of my 4 years in my high school career.
      3 years ago we had placed second both at regionals and states. From placing second at states
      we made it to nationals and placed 17th out of the 50 teams present, individually I placed 90th
      out of 350 bowlers. I have also participated in around 100 local tournaments, including a tournament
      called Pepsi which is another nationally recognized junior bowling tournament. Two years ago I placed
      6th out of the county and attended states May 5th of 2018 and won the U20 divison.
