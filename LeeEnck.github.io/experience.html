    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      I had previously attended Ephrata senior High School for my general schooling.
      My senior year I then decided to attend Brownstown Votech for Computer Systems Technology.
      There I learned how to take apart/rebuild a laptop or computer. Also how to characterize
      connectors and cables for Ethernet.

      I am now currently attending Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology majoring in computer
      Software Engineering. I personally really enjoy working with computers whether it is building/repairing
      them or now coding programs. Computing is such a facinating world and I am more than excited to see where
      it can take me in life.
